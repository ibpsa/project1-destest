# Introduction

*get text from README for the DESTEST*

This is a Tutorial to use the dedicated Python-based tool to perform the comparison and analysis of the results from the different common exercises of the DESTEST procedure from the IBPSA Project 1.

# DESTEST Comparison Tool Procedure (Step by Step)

The DESTEST Comparison Tool is a linear Graphical User Interface (GUI) that guides the user through the different steps to select a specific common exercise case and compare all results of the latter to a reference result, and compare the user result data (optional).
The comparison consists in the calculation of the difference in between the time series of the different output result parameters. This difference calculation is performed according to different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) / Comparison Metrics and grading weights that can be specified by the user.
The User can stop the DESTEST Comparison Procedure at any time by closing the GUI window (cross icon on the upper right corner of the GUI window).
