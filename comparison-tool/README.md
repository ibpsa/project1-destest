# DESTEST Comparison Tool

The DESTEST procedure consists in the comparison, benchmarking and thorough verification of a number of common exercises. In each common exercise, different participants are modelling and simulating a given case of buildings and/or energy grid. The simulation results of all participants are compared with each other by a dedicated Python-based time series comparison tool.

This repository contains the Python-based time series comparison tool. This _DESTEST comparison tool_ is available as both open-source Python file or executable file.
For more information, help and guidelines, please read the _Help and Guidelines DESTEST Comparison Tool.md_ file which can be found in this repository.
